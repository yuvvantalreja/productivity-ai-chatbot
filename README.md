Use plain english text to add new tasks, reminders or meetings. No need to set the date or exact time, simply write it and taskly will do it for you.
Taskly is smart, it greets you every morning with a message summarising your tasks and deadlines for the day. You can view your tasks in a calendar view, list view or just tell Taskly to list out the tasks remaining. 

Never have to worry about missing another deadline, because Taskly has got you covered!
